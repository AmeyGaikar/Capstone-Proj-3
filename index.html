            “I think of it as taking us back,” Jaguar managing director Rawdon Glover told MotorTrend in a brief

            a JLR representative has been about the perennially struggling luxury brand’s present and future. Lately,
            all Jaguar headlines have been about the brand cancelling all its existing models ahead of a big relaunch
            next year, the likes of which the company has been tightlipped about at best. Now, ahead of the big reveal
            this December, Glover and his team have given us a small glimpse behind the curtain.

          <p>
            It’s been another summer of record-smashing temperatures and record-smashing air travel. Airports and
            airlines say they can handle both.

            U.S. airlines expect to transport 271 million passengers worldwide this summer, up 6.3% from last season,
            the Airlines for America trade group has projected. Carriers have added flights and seats — in some cases
            too many — to accommodate the uptick.
